function SACC_SimpleMovieDemo(moviename, windowrect)
% Most simplistic demo on how to play a movie.
%
% SimpleMovieDemo(moviename [, windowrect=[]]);
%
% This bare-bones demo plays a single movie whose name has to be provided -
% including the full filesystem path to the movie - exactly once, then
% exits. This is the most minimalistic way of doing it. For a more complex
% demo see PlayMoviesDemo. The remaining demos show more advanced concepts
% like proper timing etc.
%
% The demo will play our standard DualDiscs.mov movie if the 'moviename' is
% omitted.
