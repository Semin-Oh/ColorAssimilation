-- Orientation Judgement -- 
Each trial will start with a fixation dot. Then you will see an oriented grating. After a mask, you need to adjust a line to match the orientation of the grating.
Use the left and right arrow key to move quickly around the circle, the up and down arrow keys to make fine adjustments. 
Use the space bar to confirm your choice.
